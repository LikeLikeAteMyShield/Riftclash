// Quest rewards. A quest with `reward: { cards }` (see QUESTS in progress.js)
// keeps those cards locked: hidden from the library, the deck builder and the
// decks the game builds, the AI's included, until the quest is complete. The
// play-test code unlocks them along with everything else.
//
// The player is told about each reward once: on the result screen when a game
// completes the quest, or on the main menu otherwise (for instance, a quest
// completed before it had a reward). Seen rewards are stored as card ids, so a
// card added to an old quest's reward later is still announced.
//
// Pure apart from the storage defaults, so it's unit tested in node.
